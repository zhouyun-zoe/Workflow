# CITA
In here, we will bulid the whole knowledage framework of CITA, including docs, papers and videos. Moreover, Please notice the timeliness of all the following information.

## What is CITA!

CITA（ Cryptape Inter-enterprise Trust Automation ）is a smart contract supported blockchain framework, aiming to provide a stable, efficient, flexible and future-oriented platform for enterprise-level blockchain applications. In CITA, functionalities of a blockchain node are decoupled into six microservices, including RPC, Auth, Consensus, Chain, Executor，Network. Microservices coordinate with each other via message queue. By configuring and customizing the services, CITA can meet all the needs of enterprise users.

By now, you may wonder What exactly is CITA and how to build your own blockchain network. Check [CITA Docs](https://docs.nervos.org/cita/#/zh/develop/) for the first. In here, you can get into know:

* [How to set up a simple CITA network](https://docs.nervos.org/cita/#/chain/getting_started)
* [How to config your blockchain network](https://docs.nervos.org/cita/#/chain/config_tool)
* [How to use contracts and tools to manage the system](https://docs.nervos.org/cita/#/system_management/contracts)
* [Gain insight into the architecture of CITA](https://docs.nervos.org/cita/#/architecture/architecture)

If you want to build your own application on CITA, here is the [detailed guide](https://docs.nervos.org/nervos-appchain-docs/#/quick-start/build-dapp). And there are some [demo Dapps](https://github.com/cryptape/dapp-demos).

## Contributing Changes

Read [contributing.md]() for the first.

Please keep in mind nor is code the only way to contribute to the project, we strongly value documentation and gladly accept improvements to the documentation.

### Overview

Generally, CITA uses:

* Github issue and Github Project to create, organize and track logical issues, including bugs and improvements
* CITA improvement proposal for planning major changes
* Github wiki for documentation 
* Github pull requests to manage the review and merge of specific code or docs changes

That is, Github issue and CIP are used to describe what should be fixed or changed, and high-level approaches, and pull requests describe how to implement that change in the project's source code.
